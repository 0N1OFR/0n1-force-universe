Welcome to the official **0N1 Force Universe Lore and Worldbuilding Repository**.

This is the foundation of our decentralized, global mega-IP —  
a sprawling narrative ecosystem built by visionaries, dreamers, builders, and creators from around the world.

Here you will find the living history, architecture, technologies, factions, philosophies, and mysteries that shape the world of 0N1 Force.

## 🚀 Vision

**0N1 Force** is a multi-platform storytelling universe designed for open exploration, expansion, and creation.

Our goal is to create a shared world — where games, apps, comics, films, and experiences can be built freely on top of a living, evolving lore system.

**This is more than a story. It's a revolution.**
